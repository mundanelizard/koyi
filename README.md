# Koyi

## What is Koyi?
Koyi is the Hausa(A west african language) word for 'know'. Koyi is intended to be a simple authentication
and authorization service.

## Why are you building Koyi?
In my short career as a software engineer, I've spent so much time building authentication services for 
greenfield projects. I know what you are thinking.

## Why don't you try Auth0 or firebase?
I've tried firebase, and it is a great solution, but not quite it for me. These solutions aren't opensource,
so I can't extend the solutions for niche projects

## Why don't you just use blah blah, it's opensource?
The authors of these solutions are really smart, which means I have to spend a lot of time trying to understand the codebase.

## Why is your go code so terrible?
This is my greenfield large scale project using go.


## What this project isn't?
This project isn't a solution made for everyone, you are probably better off with firebase, AuthO or other
opensource projects.

## Why should I use Koyi over others?
You don't use Koyi.

## Can I contribute?
Yeah, you can. You can help with bugs, docs, tests and general issues.
