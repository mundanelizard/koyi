# Koyi

__What is Koyi?__

Koyi is the Hausa(A west african language) word for 'know'. Koyi is intended to be a simple authentication
and authorization service.

__Why are you building Koyi?__

In my short career as a software engineer, I've spent so much time building authentication services for 
greenfield projects. I know what you are thinking.

__Why don't you try Auth0 or firebase?__

I've tried firebase, and it is a great solution, but not quite it for me. These solutions aren't opensource,
so I can't extend the solutions for niche projects

__Why don't you just use blah blah, it's opensource?__
The authors of these solutions are really smart, which means I have to spend a lot of time trying to understand the codebase.

__What this project isn't?__

- A unique solution to a problem
- A proper solution to a problem
- A usable solution to a problem
- Solving any problem

__Why should I use Koyi over others?__

Please don't use Koyi.

__Do you plan on supporting OAuth?__

Yeah, I do, but only for Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub and GitLab.

__Do you plan supporting Anonynmous login?__

Yeah, I do, but I don't think I may implement that anytime soon.

__Can I contribute?__

Yeah, you can. You can help with bugs, docs, tests and general issues.
